# CI/CD Apps

Lately, I've been trying to obtain some software to support CI/CD in my projects. As usually, I hit Google to find out there's a wide choice. As I didn't want to check every single solution I searched for a comparison and hit the wall—I didn’t come across any reasonable fact sheet.

Google recommends https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software, which is not particularly helpful in case you want to choose the software. I’ve also run through some articles with brief descriptions but no detailed information. For example, I still don't know which of the solutions executes builds faster, and it’s in my opinion crucial in case of CI.

This is why I decided to set up this page and describe my experiences with the software in a neat table.

To start with I picked ten tools I'll compare. If you have any suggestions what else should I add to my list, fork the repository and send me your pull requests: https://github.com/boudewijnwolters/continuousintegration.io/pulls
